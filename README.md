# AI-Medical-Text-Parser
An AI program in python to look through complex scientific and medical text to recognize the complex words. Provides a defintion for the term from Websters' Dictionary. Great for the purpose of understanding medical reports and scientific articles.

This project was intially created so as to let peope more simply read and understand medical text, but it has many use cases. The program is run in a simple GUI, but can be modified.

--------------------TO RUN THE PROGRAM-----------------

The project requires two python scripts as well as a binary classification dataset as a .csv file.

First, download the Medical terms dataset as a .csv file.
Next, run the program findCompText.py to create a model. This will likely take some time. Test the model with more the code that is in the comments at the bottom of the script once the model is created (To do this, you must also comment out the training program that was used to run the program).
Lastly, run the program test.py.
